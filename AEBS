### 1. Overview

The Automated Emergency Braking System (AEBS) is designed to enhance vehicle safety by automatically applying the brakes when an imminent collision is detected. This system leverages radar or LIDAR sensors to continuously monitor the vehicle's surroundings for obstacles. If the system identifies a potential collision, it activates the braking actuator to reduce the vehicle’s speed or stop it entirely, thereby preventing or mitigating the impact of an accident.

### 2. Components Required

## Radar or LIDAR Sensor:

Radar Sensor (e.g., Bosch SRR): Detects obstacles and measures their distance and speed.

LIDAR Sensor (e.g., Velodyne VLP-16): Provides high-resolution distance measurements and obstacle detection.

## BMicrocontroller:

Arduino, STM32, or Raspberry Pi: For processing sensor data and controlling the braking actuator.

## Braking Actuator:

Electronic Braking Actuator (e.g., hydraulic or pneumatic actuator): Interfaces with the vehicle’s braking system to apply brakes.

## Safety and Control System:

Relay Module: To control high-current braking actuators.

Override Control Mechanism: To allow manual braking if necessary.

## Power Supply:

12V Vehicle Power Supply or Battery Pack: To power the sensors, microcontroller, and actuators.

## Miscellaneous:

Jumper wires, resistors, and connectors: For wiring and connections.

Enclosure: To protect the electronics and sensors.

### 3. System Architecture

## The AEBS consists of several interconnected components:

## Obstacle Detection:

Radar or LIDAR sensors continuously scan the vehicle’s surroundings, detecting obstacles and measuring their distance and relative speed.

Data Processing:

The microcontroller processes the data from the sensors to determine if a collision is imminent. This involves calculating the time to collision (TTC) based on the distance and speed of approaching obstacles.

Braking Activation:

When an imminent collision is detected, the microcontroller sends a signal to the braking actuator to apply the brakes. The system must ensure that braking occurs smoothly and effectively to avoid jerky movements.

Integration with Existing Braking Systems:

The AEBS integrates with the vehicle’s existing braking system, allowing for override control if the driver manually engages the brakes. The system must ensure that it does not interfere with normal braking operations.

Safety and Override:

The system includes a manual override feature, allowing the driver to take control of braking if needed. Safety mechanisms ensure that the automated braking does not engage inappropriately.

#include <Wire.h>
#include <Adafruit_Sensor.h>
#include <Adafruit_TCS34725.h>

// Define pins for actuator control and sensor
#define ACTUATOR_PIN 9
#define SENSOR_PIN A0  // Assuming an analog sensor

// Threshold for collision detection (example value)
#define COLLISION_THRESHOLD 100  // Change based on sensor calibration

void setup() {
  pinMode(ACTUATOR_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(SENSOR_PIN, INPUT);
  
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(SENSOR_PIN);

  // Log sensor value for debugging
  Serial.print("Sensor Value: ");
  Serial.println(sensorValue);

  // Check for imminent collision
  if (sensorValue < COLLISION_THRESHOLD) {
    applyBrakes();
  } else {
    releaseBrakes();
  }

  delay(100);  // Adjust delay as needed for your system
}

void applyBrakes() {
  digitalWrite(ACTUATOR_PIN, HIGH);
  Serial.println("Brakes Applied");

}

Creating a basic prototype of an Automated Emergency Braking System (AEBS) involves integrating sensors, a microcontroller, and a braking actuator. Here’s a simplified example of source code using an Arduino microcontroller, a generic radar sensor, and a braking actuator. This example assumes that the radar sensor provides a distance measurement and that the braking actuator can be controlled by a digital output pin.

Components and Connections

Radar Sensor: Measures distance to obstacles and communicates via analog output or serial data.

Microcontroller (Arduino): Processes the sensor data and controls the braking actuator.

Braking Actuator: Activated by a digital pin to apply the brakes.

Sample Arduino Code

cpp
// Constants for the sensor and actuator
const int radarPin = A0; // Analog pin connected to the radar sensor
const int brakePin = 9;  // Digital pin connected to the braking actuator

// Threshold distance in centimeters for triggering the brakes
const int collisionThreshold = 30;

void setup() {
  // Initialize the serial communication
  Serial.begin(9600);
  
  // Set the brake pin as an output
  pinMode(brakePin, OUTPUT);
  
  // Initialize the brake actuator to off
  digitalWrite(brakePin, LOW);
}

void loop() {
  // Read the sensor value from the radar
  int sensorValue = analogRead(radarPin);
  
  // Convert the sensor value to distance in centimeters
  // This conversion depends on the specific radar sensor's characteristics
  float distance = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1023.0) * 100.0; // Example conversion
  
  // Print the distance for debugging
  Serial.print("Distance: ");
  Serial.print(distance);
  Serial.println(" cm");
  
  // Check if the distance is below the threshold
  if (distance < collisionThreshold) {
    // Activate the brakes
    digitalWrite(brakePin, HIGH);
    Serial.println("Brakes Activated!");
  } else {
    // Deactivate the brakes
    digitalWrite(brakePin, LOW);
  }
  
  // Small delay for stability
  delay(100);
}

Explanation

Pin Definitions:

radarPin is connected to the analog output of the radar sensor.

brakePin controls the braking actuator.

Setup Function:

Initializes serial communication for debugging.

Sets the brakePin as an output and ensures the brakes are initially off.

Loop Function:

Reads the sensor value from the radar and converts it to distance. The conversion factor (5.0 / 1023.0) * 100.0 is an example and depends on the sensor’s specific characteristics.

Prints the distance to the serial monitor for debugging.

Checks if the distance is below the collisionThreshold. If it is, the system activates the brakes by setting brakePin to HIGH. Otherwise, it keeps the brakes off by setting brakePin to LOW.

Includes a small delay for stability.

Notes

Sensor Calibration: The conversion from the sensor reading to distance might need calibration based on the specific sensor's data sheet and characteristics.

Braking Actuator Control: The method to control the braking actuator depends on its type. For a simple actuator, a digital pin might suffice, but more complex systems might require PWM or other control methods.

Safety: This code is a basic example. In a real-world application, additional safety checks, error handling, and testing are crucial. The system should be thoroughly tested to ensure reliable operation under various conditions.

This code serves as a starting point for developing an AEBS. For a production system, you would need more robust algorithms, fail-safes, and integration with other vehicle systems.
