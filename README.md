Explanation
The Automated Emergency Braking System (AEBS) is designed to enhance vehicle safety by automatically applying the brakes when an imminent collision is detected. This system leverages radar or LIDAR sensors to continuously monitor the vehicle's surroundings for obstacles. If the system identifies a potential collision, it activates the braking actuator to reduce the vehicle’s speed or stop it entirely, thereby preventing or mitigating the impact of an accident.

2. Components Required

Pin Definitions:

radarPin is connected to the analog output of the radar sensor.

brakePin controls the braking actuator.

Setup Function:

Initializes serial communication for debugging.

Sets the brakePin as an output and ensures the brakes are initially off.

Loop Function:

Reads the sensor value from the radar and converts it to distance. The conversion factor (5.0 / 1023.0) * 100.0 is an example and depends on the sensor’s specific characteristics.

Prints the distance to the serial monitor for debugging.

Checks if the distance is below the collisionThreshold. If it is, the system activates the brakes by setting brakePin to HIGH. Otherwise, it keeps the brakes off by setting brakePin to LOW.

Includes a small delay for stability.

Notes

Sensor Calibration: The conversion from the sensor reading to distance might need calibration based on the specific sensor's data sheet and characteristics.

Braking Actuator Control: The method to control the braking actuator depends on its type. For a simple actuator, a digital pin might suffice, but more complex systems might require PWM or other control methods.

Safety: This code is a basic example. In a real-world application, additional safety checks, error handling, and testing are crucial. The system should be thoroughly tested to ensure reliable operation under various conditions.

This code serves as a starting point for developing an AEBS. For a production system, you would need more robust algorithms, fail-safes, and integration with other vehicle systems.
